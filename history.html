        <h5>Fact #1 <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></h5>   
        <p>
                  The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the late 15th century, by Sufi Imam Muhammad Ibn Said Al Dhabhani who is known to have imported goods from Ethiopia to Yemen.

        <h5>Fact #2 <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></h5>    
        <p>
                         Coffee was first exported out of Ethiopia to Yemen by Somali merchants from Berbera and Zeila which was procured from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/am1jXjps4Jt85NZx8" target="_blank">Harar</a>.

        <h5>Fact #3 <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></h5>
                <p>
                     <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bbmFzGi7Kkf5FASV7" target="_blank">Mocha</a> historically imported up to two-thirds of their coffee from Berbera (Somalia) based merchants before the coffee trade of Mocha was captured by British-controlled Aden (Yemen) in the 19th century.

        <h5>Fact #4 <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></h5>
                <p>
                    The earliest mention of coffee noted by the literary coffee merchant Philippe Sylvestre Dufour is a reference to <i>bunchum</i> in the works of the 10th century CE Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, known as Rhazes in the West.

        <h5>Myth #1 <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></h5>
        <p>
               When Moroccan Sufi mystic Ghothul Akbar Nooruddin Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili was traveling in Ethiopia, the legend goes, he observed birds of unusual vitality feeding on berries, and, upon trying the berries, experienced the same vitality.

        <h5>Myth #2 <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></h5>        
        <p>
                         According to another ancient chronicle Sheikh Abu al-Hasan ash-Shadhili's disciple, Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from Mecca to a desert cave near Ousab. Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery, but found them to be bitter. He tried roasting the beans to improve the flavour, but they became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften the bean, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mecca, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.
