## UX

UX PROCESS

**The Strategy Plane**

“Coffee has been a growing phenomenon among Irish consumers in recent years with 75% of Irish consumers stating they drink coffee,and seven in ten drinking more than one cup a day. Sales of fresh coffee are continuing to drive growth with overall sales of instant coffee declining year on year. Coffee until recent years was considered less favourable than tea, and although tea is still the most popular hot drink in Ireland, coffee sales are growing at its expense. With Irish consumers becoming increasingly conscious of their health and alcohol intake, many consumers are choosing coffee shops as a place to socialise as opposed to a pub or restaurant.” (Ian Kennedy, Consumer and Market Insight, Bord Bia – Irish Food Board https://www.bordbia.ie/industry/news/food-alerts/irish-coffee-culture-continues-to-grow/)

THE RESEARCH PHASE
1. Primary goals of the website: build Cork Coffee Community and Promote local coffee shops and coffee roasters.
2. We are creating a static website with informational and promotional information about coffee in general and, in future releases, local coffee opportunities.
3. The business objectives of the website are set to gather coffee lovers in and around Cork, Ireland, as well as other coffee enthusiasts from around the country. The Coffee Club will host local events and facilitate collaboration between roasters and shops, cafes and bars.
4. The customer's estimated needs are to get quick, easy and trusted information about great coffee, sellers and events. In the world of coffee there is a near infinite amount of flavours, tastes and recipes. The future of the website is for customers to be able to select their favourite coffee flavours and be able to get the list of local coffee sellers who provide similar coffee that would be to their taste however this feature is not currently developed and is in the prototype stages. I have decided to focus on building the Cork Coffee Community, creating a true local Community where like minded coffee connoisseurs and lovers can meet and enjoy in Cork.

USER STORIES

Our target audience are people who have a passion for great coffee of all ages, but due to the online nature we expect most involvement from people in the 25-54 years old age brackets, as they have been determined to consume coffee the most and favour quality over quantity.

HOW THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS AND SUBSTITUTES

Similar organisations do already exist and a similar project has been found after the my MS1 topic has been selected: https://www.scaireland.ie/ SPECIALTY COFFEE ASSOCIATION – IRISH CHAPTER. This project aims to inform their users about many coffee companies (coffee shops and roasters) throughout the Republic or Ireland and Northern Ireland. While SPECIALTY COFFEE ASSOCIATION – IRISH CHAPTER project offers sustainability and educational features, their website is difficult to read, not predictable with a couple of misleading pages, e.g. when opening Education or Competitions section, the user is redirected to an external website within the same tab thus leaving the initial SPECIALTY COFFEE ASSOCIATION – IRISH CHAPTER. Another example being the Home page with the only Hover Over placeholder "Become a member", however when clicked, the user is brought to the page with the contact details of SCA IRISH CHAPTER COMMITTEE members with no clear instructions on how to actually become a member. The website has a rather chaotic presentation of information where the user would not be able to rely on his/her intuition. Our project is aimed at offering a credible, trustworthy website with intuitive experience for the user. The users' main questions will be answered upon the first landing on the Home page, mainly:
What actions can I take now?
- learn about history of coffee ("History" page)
- find the information about different coffee flavours depending on their origin ("Map Of Flavours" page)
- learn about different ways of coffee making and explore recipes ("Perfect Cup" page)
- join the cork coffee club ("Cork Coffee Club" page)
- from the footer links to the websites of the partners and sponsors, social media pages as well as contact details will be available.

### Existing Features
As our main goal is to promote the local coffee roasters and build a community, the most important features of the website will be as follows:
- the sign up option for patrons to join the community in order for them to receive informtion about the Club and its events.  
- the logos with incorporated links to the websites of the coffee roasters who are our partners and sponsors at the same time (these will be available in the footer).
 
 Other features include:
- information about coffee origins which will educate the users about the facts and myths of the coffee origins.
- a page with videos and tutorials so that some users can get inspiration and recipe information while others can share their videos (invitation to be featured on this page will be included in the welcome email when a user signs up).
