The Cork Coffee Club will host local events and facilitate collaboration between roasters and shops, cafes and bars.

## UX

UX PROCESS

**The Strategy Plane**

THE RESEARCH PHASE
“Coffee has been a growing phenomenon among Irish consumers in recent years with 75% of Irish consumers stating they drink coffee, and seven in ten drinking more than one cup a day. Sales of fresh coffee are continuing to drive growth with overall sales of instant coffee declining year on year. Coffee until recent years was considered less favourable than tea, and although tea is still the most popular hot drink in Ireland, coffee sales are growing at its expense. With Irish consumers becoming increasingly conscious of their health and alcohol intake, many consumers are choosing coffee shops as a place to socialise as opposed to a pub or restaurant.” (Ian Kennedy, Consumer and Market Insight, Bord Bia – Irish Food Board https://www.bordbia.ie/industry/news/food-alerts/irish-coffee-culture-continues-to-grow/)

1. Primary goals of the website: build Cork Coffee Community and promote local coffee shops and coffee roasters during the hosted events.
2. We are creating a static website with informational and promotional information about coffee in general and, in future releases, local coffee opportunities.
3. The business objectives of the website are set to gather coffee lovers in and around Cork, Ireland, as well as other coffee enthusiasts from around the country. The Coffee Club will host local events and facilitate collaboration between roasters and shops, cafes and bars.
4. The customer's estimated needs are to get quick, easy and trusted information about great coffee, sellers and events. In the world of coffee there is a near infinite amount of flavours, tastes and recipes. The future of the website is for customers to be able to select their favourite coffee flavours and be able to get the list of local coffee sellers who provide similar coffee that would be to their taste however this feature is not currently developed and is in the prototype stages. I have decided to focus on building the Cork Coffee Community, creating a true local Community where like minded coffee connoisseurs and lovers can meet and enjoy in Cork.

### USER STORIES

Our target audience are people of all ages who have a passion for great coffee, and we expect most involvement from people in the 25-54 years old age brackets, as they have been determined to consume coffee the most and favour quality over quantity.

HOW THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS AND SUBSTITUTES

Similar organisations do already exist and a similar project has been found: https://www.scaireland.ie/ SPECIALTY COFFEE ASSOCIATION – IRISH CHAPTER. This project aims to inform their users about many coffee companies (coffee shops and roasters) throughout the Republic or Ireland and Northern Ireland. While SPECIALTY COFFEE ASSOCIATION – IRISH CHAPTER project offers sustainability and educational features, their website is difficult to read, not predictable with a couple of misleading pages, e.g. when opening Education or Competitions section, the user is redirected to an external website within the same tab thus leaving the initial SPECIALTY COFFEE ASSOCIATION – IRISH CHAPTER. Another example being the Home page with the only Hover Over placeholder "Become a member", however when clicked, the user is brought to the page with the contact details of SCA IRISH CHAPTER COMMITTEE members with no clear instructions on how to actually become a member. The website has a rather chaotic presentation of information where the user would not be able to rely on his/her intuition.

Our project is aimed at offering a credible, trustworthy website with intuitive experience for the user. The users' main questions will be answered upon the first landing on the Home page, mainly:
- learn about history of coffee ("History" page)
- find the information about different coffee flavours depending on their origin ("Map Of Flavours" page)
- learn about different ways of coffee making and explore recipes ("Perfect Cup" page)
- join the Cork Coffee Club ("Cork Coffee Club" page)
- links to the websites of the partners and sponsors, social media pages as well as contact details will be available in the footer.

**The Scope Plane**

The website is planned to have three main releases as identified in the folowing table https://imgur.com/a/8lddGoE in order to unfold new experiences for the users. In order to consistently surprise and delight the customers, flash sales and competitions will be implemented in the future.

This website will become the building block for the coffee community, becoming their one-stop coffee shop, where true coffee fans will find like-minded friends and connections. Users will have the ability to find useful information about coffee origins and how the geographic location influences coffee beans flavour allowing users to learn where their favourite flavour comes from and open up a world of further exploration of their regions of choice. Users will have access to the library of video tutorials on coffee making, recipes and coffee art from experts.

This project is currently aiming at gathering social media followers and building a strong Community for coffee enthusiasts. I am passionate about local businesses and enterprise therefore I am dedicating my website to Cork local coffee roasters and sellers who in return may agree to become sponsors and partners in creating memorable coffee experiences for our Community, such as various coffee events, competitions, lessons. In the future I am aiming to have various local coffee brands in one online shop where not only coffee products will be available but also merchandise, gift cards, coffee kits and wholesale options. 

This website can be sellable as it will have a clientele needed for coffee business needs.

**The Structure Plane**

The website has the nav bar that will feature five linear menu elements representing the five main sections of the coffee project, namely:
- Home
- History 
- Map of Flavors 
- Perfect Cup
- Cork Coffee Club

The footer will appear on each of the tabs and will have the following information to hand:
- Partners and Sponsors 
- Social networks 
- Contact details  
- Copyright 
	
Home page will briefly introduce the content of all the other website pages with the links to them in order to create a more intuitive experience for the user.

In the PC version, the navigation is represented by the Nav bar with inline elements. In future releases the nav bar items will have room for subcategories. In the mobile version the navigation will be represented by the Burger Icon. In the future releases the burger icon will have room for additional layers.

**The Sceleton Plane**

Wireframe built with Balsamic can be found in the project documents under the following directory name: cork_coffee_club_wireframe.pdf 

**The Surface Plane**

Courier font is used across the website.

The most important elements must be abd are currently easily recognized:

- videos: are visible on pages
- navigation: has hover over effect

Color palette of the website consists of brown colour shades, black and white colours representing different coffee colours, milk and black coffee respectively.

Home, History, Perfect Cup and Cork Coffee Club pages have similarly positioned paragraphs to make the wesbite browsing more intuitive for its users.

## Testing

The following tests were performed:
- Website appears to work well in other browsers (i.e Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

The following test conclusions were made:
1. All links are working as intended:
    - the logo on the top left brings the user back to the Home page.
    - the links in the main content on the Home page bring the user to the correct pages (i. e. "history of coffee" to "History" page, "coffee flavour" to "Map Of Flavours" page, "recipes and tutorials" to "Perfect Cup" page, "join the Cork Coffee Club" to "Cork Coffee Club" page).
    - the Bean Belt image on the Map Of Flavours page brings the user to the image source and opens in a new tab.
    - all the videos on the Home page and Perfect Cup page open in YouTube in a new tab when clicked.
    - video on the Home page auto plays and is muted.
    - partners and sponsors logos in the footer are linked to the official websites of those companies and open in a new tab.
    - social media links open their official websites and open in a new tab.
2. Sign Up form. Steps taken to test:
    - Go to the "Cork Coffee Club" page
    - Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    - Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    - Try to submit the form with a valid email address but without making a selection on the radio buttons and verify that a relevant error message appears
    - Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
3. Hover over effect works in the following elements with all screen sizes:
    - Nav bar (menu items).
    - White text on the Home and History pages.
    - Sign up button on the Cork Coffee Club page.
4.  Video on the home page autoplays and is muted.
5. Map Of Flavours page.
    - Text about coffee flavours appears above the image as the screen gets smaller, as the text on the image would not be readable otherwise.
6. Burger menu replaces the nav bar as the screen gets smaller.
7. The Pop-up Nav bar for mobile-sized devices is intentionally sticking out on the right-hand side to prompt users to peak inside there to discover more and trigger further steps.

BUGS

Cork Coffee Club page. The form does not allow any input, the radio buttons and the sign-up button do not respond to any action. The bug was fixed by splitting the main content into two separate sections: one with the four text columns and the other with the form itself.

Another existing bug: the nav pop-up window from the burger menu partially covers its "close window" icon on some mobile devices.

## Deployment

The project had to be rewritten from scratch in order to allow more frequent commits. More frequents commits will be ensured for future releases.
